// Step By Step
function VowelCount (str) {
  // First, we Remove all characters in the string that aren't vowels with the .replace method.
  // Note that ^ in Regex means "all characters not in the set", so placing it in front of aeiou means "Match everything that isn't a vowel"
  // Enclosing a set in [] means that our string matches any individual character in that set
  // Ending with our /g tag signifies that we want to do a global search and lets our engine know to going through the entire string.
  str = str.replace(/[^aeiuo]/g, '');

  // Finally, we return the length of the string to "count" how many vowels are left.
  return str.length;
