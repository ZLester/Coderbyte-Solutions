Coderbyte-Solutions
===================

After finishing all of Coderbyte's easy and medium challenges, I thought it might be useful for both myself (and anyone else learning javascript by completing these challenges) to go back through each challenge with cleaner/well-commented code. Note that this repo is aimed at allowing novice programmers the ability to follow along and are by no means the most optimized/best solutions.

#### Feel free to contribute your own solutions/improve the solutions I've created!
